    <!-- Poem -->
    <p>
        I met a traveller from an antique land,<br>
        Who said—“Two vast and trunkless legs of stone<br>
        Stand in the desert. . . . Near them, on the sand,<br>
        Half sunk a shattered visage lies, whose frown,<br>
        And wrinkled lip, and sneer of cold command,<br>
        Tell that its sculptor well those passions read<br>
        Which yet survive, stamped on these lifeless things,<br>
        The hand that mocked them, and the heart that fed;<br>
        And on the pedestal, these words appear:<br>
        My name is <span class="oz">Ozymandias</span>, King of Kings;<br>
        Look on my Works, ye Mighty, and despair!<br>
    </p>
